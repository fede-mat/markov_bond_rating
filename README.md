# Markov Chain Analysis of US Bond Ratings

## Description
This project analyzes the stochastic evolution of US bond ratings using a Markov Chain model. The transition matrix representing the bond ratings is imported from historical data, and the analysis includes:
- Graphical representation of the Markov Chain.
- Asymptotic evolution and steady-state behavior.
- Mean return times for each state.
- Default probability evolution over time.
- Simulation of bond rating transitions over 100 steps.

## Work in Progress
Please note that this project is a **work in progress**. As I am currently attending a course on **Stochastic Dynamic Models** this semester, further refinements and insights will be incorporated as I deepen my understanding of the subject. 

## Future Improvements
- Incorporation of advanced stochastic modeling techniques.
- Analysis of real-world data with updated transition matrices.
- Exploration of alternative models for credit rating transitions.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the MATLAB script to generate the figures and perform the analysis.
